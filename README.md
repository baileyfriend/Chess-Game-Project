# Chess-Game-Project

This is a Chess Game project for GVSU CIS 163 course. Some code in this project was provided by our instructor. At this point, we do NOT want any help from anyone outside our group. 

You may, however view our code if you would like. We will not be accepting any commits at this time.

Thank you :)
